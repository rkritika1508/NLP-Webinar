       "' Your pardon, your Grace.  She did nothing I did not command.  I am the King’s Hand -  - trying to keep the peace - He butchered my men.  Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.  If we don’t act… there will be a war.  And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?  As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight. The hunt? The Targaryen girl -  These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner.  You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.  I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.  You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep.  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.  Grand Maester Pycelle.  Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm. Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?  I’m sending you both back to Winterfell.  Listen -  What? No.  This isn’t a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.  When you’re old enough, I’ll make you a match with someone who’s worthy of you, someone who’s brave and gentle and strong -  Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.  “Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”  Another visit? lt seems you\\'re my last friend.  On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?  l don\\'t know what you want. l\\'ve given up trying to guess.  Huh. Can you free me from this pit?  What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?  Robb? He\\'s just a boy.  Stannis Baratheon is Robert\\'s true heir. The throne is his by rights.  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago. The King\\'s tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.  You\\'ll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.  You found money for a champion\\'s purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I\\'ll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left. The sooner this is over, the better. I\\'m sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there\\'s nothing else, my Lords?  I\\'ve been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.  Why?  What did Jon want the night before he died?  A book? What book? I\\'d like to read it.  \"Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon\\'s landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained  Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?  Jon\\'s death...  Did he say anything to you during his final hours?  \"The seed is strong\"? What does that mean? And you\\'re quite certain he died of a natural illness?  Poison.  I\\'ve heard it said that poison is a woman\\'s weapon.  Everybody knows that. I\\'ve taken enough of your time.  Thank you. I\\'ll find my own way out.  It\\'s a hard fall down these steps.  Cats? Syrio says…  He\\'s right about that. He needs to get his strength back first. No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King\\'s Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder. You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords. Pycelle talks too much.  Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?  Where is Ser Hugh? I\\'ll speak to him. Varys or the Queen?  Yes.  Why? Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.  A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who\\'ve never seen an arrow coming their way. Let them look.  What did Lord Arryn want?  I\\'d like to see him as well. This is fine work. There\\'s nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about? What kind of questions? Your mother? What did you tell him? Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy\\'d rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me. King Robert\\'s bastard son. Your Grace. Putting my name on it doesn\\'t make it mine.  She likes it here. What are you doing here?  The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that\\'s what I\\'ll do until he tells me otherwise.  If that\\'s my job, then so be it.  I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace. Get the girls settled in. I\\'ll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them. Glad to see you\\'re protecting the throne.  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it. You\\'ve chosen your opponents wisely then.  But you just stood there and watched. Is that what you tell yourself at night? You\\'re a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen\\'s back?  You served him well, when serving was safe. Lord Varys.  A shame you didn\\'t say a prayer for the butcher\\'s son. Renly! You\\'re looking well.  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well. Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.  Grand Maester. And you served another King.  Without the King? 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?  How could you let this happen?  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.  I\\'ll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.  What\\'s happening here?  Go to your room. We\\'ll speak later. That\\'s for you, love…  The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella\\'s toys. Don\\'t you like it?  It\\'s all right. Go on. War was easier than daughters. Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?  Give it to me. I know this maker\\'s mark. This is Mikken\\'s work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn\\'t play with swords.  Come here. Now what do you want with this?  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting? [laughs] That\\'s the essence of it.  No, sweet girl. You didn\\'t kill the butcher\\'s boy.  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar. Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he\\'s wrong. Well… Look at me. You\\'re a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words. You were born in the long summer. You\\'ve never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister. I don\\'t want to frighten you, but I won\\'t lie to you either. We\\'ve come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It\\'s yours.  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you\\'re going to own a sword, you\\'d better know how to use it.  My wife is in Winterfell. You\\'re a funny man. A very funny man.  It\\'s too dangerous.  Until we know who our enemies are...  Littlefinger\\'s right. I can\\'t do anything without proof. Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he\\'s still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing. He still loves you. Off with you.  I have no choice.  You can. You must. There\\'s great honor serving in the Night\\'s Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood. The next time we see each other, we\\'ll talk about your mother. I promise.  I\\'ve half a mind to go with you. You should have asked me 20 years ago.  I recall a few chances.  Bessie. She was one of yours.  Wylla.  Nor will I. The worst thing about your coronation... I\\'ll never get to hit you again.  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift? She\\'s little more than a child.  Tell me we\\'re not speaking of this.  But you can\\'t get your hands on this one, can you? Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert. He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we\\'ll throw him back into the sea. Where is she? Who took her? Right, get back. Back! Back to the inn. All back! Are you hurt? It\\'s all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once? In bed asleep. Stop it! That\\'s enough of that. Stop! Arya! Gladly, your Grace. You can\\'t mean it. s this your command... your Grace? No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I\\'ll do it myself.  The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher. The butcher\\'s boy... You rode him down? Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital? He\\'d never worn this armor before. Who determines the draw? Aye... But who holds the straws? You\\'ve done good work, Sisters. I\\'m glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don\\'t think the widow\\'s life would suit her. My father once told me you were the best he\\'d ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat. And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor? Yes. That will never happen. If the King got what he wanted all the time, we\\'d still be fighting a damned rebellion. You\\'re too fat for your armor. You\\'re torturing the poor boy. The breastplate stretcher? Maybe you should have one invented. You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men. And who\\'s going to hit you back?There\\'s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you. Aye. I\\'m not thirsty. Your squire... A Lannister boy? Robert? Where\\'s Arya Hey. Ser Loras rides well. He\\'ll never walk again. So they say. I\\'ve been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this? So why do you trust me now? What sort of doom does the King face? Who gave it to him? The squire, Ser Hugh? If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh? Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him? You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop. Who did? Oh, Arya. Where did you hear this? What were you doing in the dungeons? Your name, friend? Did Benjen send you? Ah, we\\'ll find recruits for you. Know what? Go on. We\\'ll talk more later. Jory, take her safely to her room. Well? I need to see the King first -- alone. Is it about my wife? You\\'re speaking of murdering a child. You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this. Then we\\'re no better than the Mad King. You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor? Based on whose information? Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact? He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man? The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I\\'ll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water. I followed you into war -  twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn\\'t tremble at the shadow of an unborn child. I will have no part in it. And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man. I\\'ll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don\\'t ask anyone for help. What can I do for you? Why? What do you care? I don\\'t have the time. Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls\\' chambers. Who are your best two swords? Find them and meet me at the stables. Aye. I will. When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want? She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing. What do you know of King Robert\\'s bastards? How many? And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why? Come. Jory! I remember him well.He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes. You kill me, your brother\\'s a dead man.'"
